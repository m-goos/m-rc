# Exploring Finance: Movies and Docus

Recently, I've started working as a software engineer for a trading firm, specifically an options "market maker"[^1]. I'm now learning about the industry - about finance, trading and high frequency trading technology. Most of my knowledge comes from day to day work, continued onboarding and discussions with colleagues. It's fascinating. I supplement this with some books (which will be covered in another post) and films/documentaries which I'll list below. Some of the films and documentaries, I watched before I was interviewing for a trading firm; some I've watched more recently.

These documentaries are by no means a complete view of modern finance, and given the pace of technological development in trading, most information about technology is either outdated or accurate only in the sense that they give an impression of how things are built. Due to the complexity of today’s financial systems, they cannot delve deeply into all relevant aspects, but they serve as a useful and accessible introduction to the sector.

In general, quite a few of movies and documentaries about the financial sector are made either about or around the 2008 global financial crisis. There is much more to the financial system than this, but it is understandable that a lot of attention is still there.

Note that _when_ these films and documentaries were made is important. Culturally, I suspect much of the narrative around finance remains consistent - perhaps this evolves by the decade. However, technology in the industry evolves incredibly fast and can change majorly in a few years or less. Furthermore, while watching, it is good to distinguish between trading firms that trade with a strong opinion of where the market is moving (high risk/high reward, potentially big market impact), and trading firms like market makers that focus on facilitating trades rather than speculating on price movements (low risk, minimal market impact).

## Documentaries
