# My Strategy for Learning a New Programming Language

This year I'll start working in Java, to contribute to the backend of the product I work on. I've done backend development in `NodeJS` before: Using Express, Lambdas in AWS or for middleware like Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Functions. Never in Java though, so before anything, I'll have to learn `Java`.

This post describes my steps to master Java. It's my personal learning plan for _any_ new programming language, because I anticipate to follow in the footsteps of Java with another programming language, and another, and...

For some time I have been inspired by the idea of Learning in Public, to _"make the thing you wish you had found when you were learning"_[^1]. Writing about what and how I learn helps consolidate my learnings and it might be helpful to others.

This post is my first attempt at Learning in Public. And the thing I wish I had found when I started learning is a simple way to learn Java, including limited but sufficient resources.

## Goal: Contribute a weekly backend Pull Request for the product I work on

The level I want to reach in Java is that I can contribute small, weekly chunks of useful functionality for the product I work on. At that level, I am confident that my learning will accelerate. Then, I will not only be learning in my spare time, but from making meaningful contributions to my team.

## Learning strategy

Based on my personal learning experience for JavaScript and what are considered the best practices for learning new programming languages, this is how I'll approach learning Java:

1. Read just enough theory to start coding
2. Do coding exercises
3. Read a book on the new programming language
4. Build small real-world applications
5. Create features in professional context

Now this approach is still generic, so where should I start? Initially, I started with a Udemy course, but that was too passive, dry and slow. Then, I came across a post on LinkedIn with great resources for Java[^2]. This is how I will start:

1. _Read just enough theory to start coding_ - Read the official Java developer tutorials: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/TOC.html
2. _Do coding exercises_ - Complete the free Exercism Java track: https://exercism.org/tracks/java
3. _Read a book on the new programming language_ - There are many, I will be reading "Learning Java: An Introduction to Real-World Programming with Java (5th edition)"
4. _Build small real-world applications_ - Write small versions of full applications or tools, e.g. command line tools, following example projects as presented in 'Coding Challenges' [^2]
5. _Create features in professional context_ - Contribute to the codebase of my team.
6. _Continue leveling up_: Read more books, build more copies of real-world applications.

That's it, you now speak another language.
