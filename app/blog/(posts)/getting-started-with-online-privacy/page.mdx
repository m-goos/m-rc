# Online privacy is finally cool, so.. where to start?

Reading about privacy feels like reading conspiracy theories. What you read seems improbable, dystopian and kind of crazy. However, the difference between some random conspiracy theory and the case of our online privacy, is that those dystopian stories about our privacy are not fiction ‚Äî they are actually true! With everything we do on the internet, we share information about ourselves, and most of us have no clue how this information is being used.

## Why even ‚Äòbig tech‚Äô calls for action

Now I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you saw Netflix‚Äôs The Social Dilemma in the past year, a (very dramatic) documentary that shows us the dark side of social media and big tech. From the people that created the üëç Like button at Facebook, to the behavioral scientists that made Instagram as addictive as possible, we hear how things go behind the scenes. How all our data is analyzed to predict our behavior, how elections are being manipulated and how our attention is being sold (get that conspiracy-feeling now?). Nothing new apparently, and if this left you feeling as uneasy as I felt, I guess that‚Äôs good‚Ä¶ ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0))

**The takeaway is clear: time for some action.** As an IT professional, I think I should take some responsibility and not be lazy about my online privacy. Hopefully, I‚Äôll motivate you to join in the effort.

## The privacy rabbit hole

Following my new privacy goal (to actually start considering my privacy), I went down the privacy rabbit hole. As I got lost, I proved a point to myself: How difficult it is to find out where to start, and how hard it is to understand what services, platforms and apps I should avoid ‚Äî however convenient they might be. To find out for what reasons these should be avoided, and what alternatives there are. Quickly, you‚Äôll find out that if you are not paying with your personal data, you will generally be paying money for the services you want to use.

So where do I start? The goal of this blog is zooming back out, providing you, and myself, with the perspective we need to get started on improving our online privacy. An overview and a starting point, while I make an effort to explain the path I take.

## Please accept all tracking cookies: Action list for this blog series

As the goal is to take some major steps for the remainder of this year, this is a list of topics that I will look into, with different blogs over the coming months:

1.  Privacy friendly web browsing: please accept our tracking cookies to continue.
2.  Implementing security best practices: Passwords, 2FA/MFA, Password manager.
3.  Encrypting your internet connection: VPN, Ad blocking (Pi-hole).
4.  Emailing: Own your domain and email with a secure service.
5.  Social Media: Why I left Facebook and Instagram, why I haven‚Äôt left LinkedIn yet, and next steps.
6.  Smartphone: Privacy measures, location services and secure messaging.

Of course, these are my first ideas, and the list is by no means exhaustive. I‚Äôll surely learn and adjust over the coming months and this will be the springboard.

## Reflections and next steps

There is so much to say about privacy that it is really hard for me to keep this brief. I would like to make the point why we should care about privacy, but that would drag me down a lengthy philosophical discussion. I would like to dive into how far it makes sense to ‚Äòget into privacy‚Äô. Into social media, into the difference between privacy, anonymity and secrecy, into cryptocurrencies and anonymous payments, into ‚Ä¶

Well, as you see, there are plenty of rabbit holes to go down here. Once you start making an effort to respect your own privacy, you can go as far as you want. For now, I will leave you with some of my favourite resources as I start working on the first topic in my privacy to-do list.

## Resources

If this blog has made you curious, here are some nice resources to get started:

- Read from hacker and a security researcher Jeffrey Paul, [e.g. on emailing](https://sneak.berlin/20201029/stop-emailing-like-a-rube/).
- Check out these privacy guides from security and privacy researcher [Sun Knudsen](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBTp6wwfQk3iFYpo6gGRUgZy-h-vBzMK4) on youtube.
- Why ‚ÄúI have nothing to hide‚Äù is [such a bad argument](https://medium.com/@FabioAEsteves/i-have-nothing-to-hide-why-should-i-care-about-my-privacy-f488281b8f1d) to not care about privacy.
