# Setting up this blog

The past week I have been finalizing the setup of this blog. For now, I have not had the space to write extensively about the process and my learnings.

For anyone that is interested, the code for this blog can be found in [this repository on github](https://github.com/m-goos/m-rc).

## Learnings

Already, I have learnt a great deal about:

- NextJS: Setup, building, images and configuring Markdown (MDX)
- Open Source `Terraform` modules (see the infrastructure folder in github)
- Prioritizing, or: How to get things done for a side-project
- Working in small increments: Even while working alone, small, well-defined PRs are vital
- Building Momentum: Simply publishing every little improvement I make

There is a big and growing list of improvements for this blog which you'll find in `TODO.md` [in the repository](https://github.com/m-goos/m-rc/blob/main/TODO.md). But there is also a big list of completed items - you are looking at this blog right now and that's the point! ðŸ˜‰

Thanks for reading - I'll keep you posted here!
