# Next steps for this website

This is the place to collect all TODOs. As a reminder to myself: Before I pick something up, have a look at:

- Priority
- Scope vs available time

## TODO

- [ ] github actions with deploy
- [ ] simple e2e test to verify website was deployed correctly
- [ ] monitoring / notification (telegram?)
- [ ] dark mode for the website
- [ ] Write a monthly post - write about what I build, even for the blog
- [ ] BLOGS:
  - [ ] Check links on all blogs - are the links correct and alive?
  - [ ] Improve blog preview list with reading time
  - [ ] Improve blogs with date, author, tags
  - [ ] When scrolling to the bottom of a blog, it's not clear that it is finished - some footer or message at the end.
- [ ] set up 'Playground', all projects are now deployed and code is public
- [ ] set up 'Playground' and explain idea - add some cards with image / demo
- [ ] draft-status for blogs and a button to show/hide them
- [ ] optimize images
