# Next steps for this website

This is the place to collect all TODOs. As a reminder to myself: Before I pick something up, have a look at:

- Priority
- Scope vs available time

## TODO

- [ ] fix css bug - when navigating: home-blog-playground, the contents jumps a bit left
- [ ] github actions with deploy
- [ ] simple e2e test to verify website was deployed correctly
- [ ] dark mode for the website
- [ ] Write a monthly post - write about what I build, even for the blog
- [ ] monitoring / notification (telegram?)
- [ ] BLOGS:
  - [ ] Check links on all blogs - are the links correct and alive?
  - [ ] Improve blog preview list with reading time
  - [ ] Improve blogs with date, author, tags
  - [ ] When scrolling to the bottom of a blog, it's not clear that it is finished - some footer or message at the end - e.g. "Back to blogs" and "Suggested reading" (this can later be related reading)
  - [ ] Add tags to blogs with various topics; later on, these will be handy for relating and filtering content.
- [ ] set up 'Playground', all projects are now deployed and code is public
- [ ] set up 'Playground' and explain idea - add some cards with image / demo. Small explanation on the blogs section as well, to explain that 'web projects i build and deploy' are in the playground including some description. - even a small script to pull in descriptions from my public github account would be great.
- [ ] draft-status for blogs and a button to show/hide them
- [ ] optimize images - use cloud image provider
- [ ] mailing list: signup + alerting
- [ ] storybook or something similar (simpler) for the components I build
