I built a component library at:

- Elsevier
- TS1
- TS2

Only one _started_ with a decent design systems and this was the biggest difference in the world.

I think the mistake we made was then taking that design system and building all the components with it ourselves - It would have saved us months if we would have just picked a library and customized it according to the tokens defined in design system. Rather than re-inventing buttons for ourselves.
